          Ginni Market is a solo project inspired by the idea of building a
          stock market from the ground upâ€”not for profit, but purely for fun and
          learning. The goal is to create an interactive and engaging platform
          where users can explore market dynamics, trading concepts, and
          financial strategies in a simplified and enjoyable way. By stripping
          away the complexities of real-world stock markets, Ginni Market offers
          a space for experimentation, education, and entertainment, making
          finance more accessible to everyone.
